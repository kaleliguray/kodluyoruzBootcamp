# Graduation Project

There are two different projects Which are my graduation project in the repo. One of them is a *core java project*. In this project I tried to make a **"Caesar Encryption"**. The other one is a *spring boot project*. I wanted to create a **"Lesson Automation System"**. At the below I explained which dependency I used and how I coded the project. Also I put a sql-uml diagram *(name = "Lesson.pdf" inside = "lessons")* in the project folder.Thus; you may see how I designed my relation between entitys clearly.
